In this study, we utilized the E-DAIC (Extended Distress Analysis Interview Corpus-Wizard-of-Oz) dataset, an extended version of the DAIC-WOZ dataset, which consists of semi-clinical interviews conducted by an animated virtual interviewer called Ellie, controlled by a human interviewer in another room. With 275 participants, the E-DAIC dataset represents a valuable resource for investigating depression detection methods. Our aim is to predict PHQ-8 scores through text analysis. Leveraging state-of-the-art speech processing, LLM-based text summarization, and a specialized depression detection module, we demonstrate the transformative potential of language data analysis in enhancing depression screening. By overcoming the limitations of manual feature extraction methods, our automated techniques provide a more efficient and effective means of evaluating depression. In our evaluation, we achieve robust accuracy on the development set of the E-DAIC dataset, with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 3.65 in estimating PHQ-8 scores from recorded interviews. This remarkable performance highlights the efficacy of our approach in automatically predicting depression severity. Our research contributes to the growing evidence supporting the use of LLMs in mental health assessment, showcasing the role of innovative technologies in advancing patient care for depression.<br><br><b>Keywords: Depression detection; mental health; large language models; text analysis; DAIC dataset<br> <br><h2>Links</h2>[<a href="pdfs/1570918113.pdf">Full text PDF</a>][<a href="bib/1570918113.bib">Bibtex</a>] <br> </html>
