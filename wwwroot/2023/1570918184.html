<h1> Fractal Bilinear Deep Neural Network Models for Gastric Intestinal Metaplasia Detection</h1><br><i><b> Maria P Silva; Miguel L. Martins; Diogo Libanio; MÃ¡rio Dinis-Ribeiro; Miguel Coimbra; Francesco Renna</b></i><br><h2>Abstract</h2><br>Gastric Intestinal Metaplasia (GIM) is a precancerous gastric lesion and its early detection facilitates patient followup, thus lowering significantly the risk of death by gastric cancer. However, effective screening of this condition is a very challenging task, resulting low intra and inter-observer concordance. Computer assisted diagnosis systems leveraging deep neural networks (DNNs) have emerged as a way to mitigate these ailments. Notwithstanding, these approaches typically require large datasets in order to learn invariance to the extreme variations typically present in Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) still frames, such as perspective, illumination, and scale. Hence, we propose to combine a priori information regarding texture characteristics of GIM with data-driven DNN solutions. In particular, we define two different models that treat pre-trained DNNs as general features extractors, whose pairwise interactions with a collection of highly invariant local texture descriptors grounded on fractal geometry are computed by means of an outer product in the embedding space. Our experiments show that these models outperform a baseline DNN by a significant margin over several metrics (e.g., area under the curve (AUC) 0.792 vs. 0.705) in a dataset comprised of EGD narrow-band images. Our best model measures double the positive likelihood ratio when compared to a baseline GIM detector.<br><br><b>Keywords: Gastric Intestinal Metaplasia; Deep learning; Fractal Geometry; Narrow-band imaging; Bilinear models<br> <br><h2>Links</h2>[<a href="pdfs/1570918184.pdf">Full text PDF</a>][<a href="bib/1570918184.bib">Bibtex</a>] <br> </html>
