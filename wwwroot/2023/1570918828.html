<h1> Role of Permutations in Biclustering Algorithms for Medical Imaging</h1><br><i><b> Aditya Shreeram; Tanmayee Samantaray; Cota Navin Gupta</b></i><br><h2>Abstract</h2><br>Biclustering is a data driven technique that can reveal two dimensional clusters (sub matrices) in a matrix. This technique overcomes one of the main disadvantages of clustering, which is finding global patterns, but failing to find local patterns. It has been widely used in the field of bioinformatics to find similarly expressed genes (highly expressed or repressed genes) in a gene expression matrix. When applied onto structural MRI (sMRI), where it's a quite new concept, it can reveal novel perspectives such as subgroups within a group of subjects suffering from a disease. N-BiC is one such biclustering algorithm based on an exhaustive N-component search. The algorithm is a recursive Depth First Search, which can be less efficient, resource intensive and time consuming over iterative approaches. It is also dependent on the search arrangement and hence permutation is needed to explore and merge the potential biclusters. In this work, we have improved the N-BiC method by comparing each bicluster with rest of the biclusters, which decreases the algorithmic run time and eliminating the permutation step. Based on iteratively deepening Depth First Search, Modified N-BiC performs similar to N-BiC and requires less memory, making it possible to run it on a device with modest specifications<br><br><b>Keywords: Biclustering; structural Magnetic resonance imaging; Iterative deepening Depth first search; Data mining; Subtyping<br> <br><h2>Links</h2>[<a href="pdfs/1570918828.pdf">Full text PDF</a>][<a href="bib/1570918828.bib">Bibtex</a>] <br> </html>
