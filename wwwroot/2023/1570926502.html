<h1> Dynamic Brain Transformer with Multi-level Attention for Brain Network Analysis</h1><br><i><b> Xuan Kan; Antonio Aodong Chen Gu; Hejie Cui; Ying Guo; Carl Yang</b></i><br><h2>Abstract</h2><br>Recent neuroimaging advancements have highlighted the importance of network-centric brain analysis, particularly with functional magnetic resonance imaging. The emergence of Deep Neural Networks has fostered a substantial interest in predicting clinical outcomes and categorizing individuals based on brain networks. However, the conventional approach involving static brain network analysis offers limited potential in capturing the dynamism of brain function. Although recent studies have attempted to harness dynamic brain networks, their high dimensionality and complexity present substantial challenges. This paper proposes a novel methodology, Dynamic bRAin Transformer (DART), which combines static and dynamic brain networks for more effective and nuanced brain function analysis. Our model uses the static brain network as a baseline, integrating dynamic brain networks to enhance performance against traditional methods. We innovatively employ attention mechanisms, enhancing model explainability and exploiting the dynamic brain network's temporal variations. The proposed approach offers a robust solution to the low signal-to-noise ratio of blood-oxygen-level-dependent signals, a recurring issue in direct DNN modeling. It also provides valuable insights into which brain circuits or dynamic networks contribute more to final predictions. As such, DRAT shows a promising direction in neuroimaging studies, contributing to the comprehensive understanding of brain organization and the role of neural circuits.<br><br><b>Keywords: Dynamic Brain Networks; Deep Learning<br> <br><h2>Links</h2>[<a href="pdfs/1570926502.pdf">Full text PDF</a>][<a href="bib/1570926502.bib">Bibtex</a>] <br> </html>
