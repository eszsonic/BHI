<h1> Camera-based Plantar Perfusion Imaging for Detecting Lower Limb Arterial Blockage</h1><br><i><b> Yukai Huang; Dongmin Huang; Jia Wu; Hongzhou Lu; Min He; Wenjin Wang</b></i><br><h2>Abstract</h2><br>Lower limb arterial blockage (LLAB) is an early symptom of peripheral arterial disease (PAD), a common circulatory problem caused by the accumulation of fat and cholesterol in arteries as a result of atherosclerosis in the lower limbs. PAD can be diagnosed by detecting LLAB, which blocks the blood flow from leg to foot and causes a decrease of plantar blood perfusion. Camera-based photoplethysmographic imaging, a non-contact imaging technique for measuring skin perfusion, is a potential tool to detect LLAB for the early diagnosis of PAD. Cameras have been used for vital signs monitoring, such as heart rate, respiration rate and blood oxygen saturation, but its potential for PAD analysis has not been explored. In this paper, we investigate the new concept of using a regular camera to measure the skin perfusion of plantar for LLAB detection. Instead of imaging the facial skin perfusion as current vital signs camera, we use the camera to analyze the blood perfusion of plantar skin surface. We constructed an imaging setup and designed a lab-simulated experiment involving 20 subjects, where an inflatable cuff is applied to block the blood flow of the left leg to simulate LLAB. The experimental results show that the camera-based plantar perfusion imagers can clearly differentiate between the leg applied with cuff (simulated LLAB) and the leg in the normal state.<br><br><b>Keywords: Lower limb arterial blockage; perfusion imaging; camera-based pulse wave; peripheral arterial disease; video health monitoring<br> <br><h2>Links</h2>[<a href="pdfs/1570918592.pdf">Full text PDF</a>][<a href="bib/1570918592.bib">Bibtex</a>] <br> </html>
