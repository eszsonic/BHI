<h1> Host-directed vibroacoustic biosignature of viral respiratory infection</h1><br><i><b> Andreas Schuh; Michael Morimoto; Piotr Kaszuba; Kevin Hammond; Jerry Swan; Krzysztof Krawiec; Nelson L Jumbe</b></i><br><h2>Abstract</h2><br>Respiratory infection testing, patient risk, and clinical costs are driven by disease prevalence, direct and downstream costs of false-positive/negative tests. In addition, false-positives decrease with disease prevalence, while -negatives increase. We developed a host response-based, easy to use, fast, low-cost, non-invasive respiratory infection detection system and used COVID-19 as a mechanism for assessing host vibroacoustic biosignatures based accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity to distinguish SARS-CoV-2 carriers from non-carriers in a diverse US, Indian, and African population. 
A vibroacoustic infrasound-to-ultrasound e-stethoscope that can detect a respiratory infection early in both asymptomatic and vaguely  symptomatic, like cough, patients that could be a tool  to meet current as well as future needs as viral pathogens come and go, seasonally and within pandemics.<br><br><b>Keywords: vibroacoustic; vibrome; biosignature; host response; acute lung injury<br> <br><h2>Links</h2>[<a href="pdfs/1570927544.pdf">Full text PDF</a>][<a href="bib/1570927544.bib">Bibtex</a>] <br> </html>
