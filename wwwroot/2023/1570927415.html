<h1> An Integrated Approach for Focal Cortical Dysplasia Lesion Validation on Preoperative Assessments</h1><br><i><b> Josue D Rodriguez; Mercedes Cabrerizo; Marcos A. Bosques; Ilker Yaylali; Malek Adjouadi</b></i><br><h2>Abstract</h2><br>In this study, we present an innovative approach that integrates EEG-based functional connectivity analysis and MRI-derived cortical thickness measurements, reflecting the principles of Precision Systems Medicine. This combined methodology enhances the precision of Focal Cortical Dysplasia (FCD) lesion validation in preoperative assessments for pediatric epilepsy, thereby establishing a foundation for improved surgical outcomes. Our case study confirms the consistent detection of the Caudal Middle Frontal region, supporting the potential of our method to increase the accuracy of surgical planning for FCD-related epilepsy. The broader implications extend to neurology and precision medicine, embodying a systems-level understanding of individual patients. While we recognize the need for further large-scale research, our study represents a significant stride towards a comprehensive, patient-centered, and data-driven approach to epilepsy treatment planning. This resonates with the objective of Precision Systems Medicine-delivering highly individualized healthcare based on complex system-level patient understanding.<br><br><b>Keywords: Focal Cortical Dysplasia (FCD); EEG-based functional connectivity; MRI-derived cortical thickness measurements; Pediatric epilepsy; Precision medicine<br> <br><h2>Links</h2>[<a href="pdfs/1570927415.pdf">Full text PDF</a>][<a href="bib/1570927415.bib">Bibtex</a>] <br> </html>
