<h1> Exploring Opportunities and Challenges of AI-incorporated Biomedical Informatics Education: A Qualitative Study</h1><br><i><b> Xiaopeng Zhao; Mehmet Aydeniz; Fengpei Yuan</b></i><br><h2>Abstract</h2><br>This article presents a case study on the integration of AI as a teaching and learning tool in a biomedical informatics course for college education. The article details the design of the course and its methodology, including hands-on learning, in-class activities, and weekly assignments that utilized AI tools. An exploratory qualitative study was conducted with six college students to learn their perceptions and learning experience with this AI-incorporated course. We applied thematic analysis approach to investigate the opportunities and challenges of integrating AI in college education. The course generated positive outcomes, highlighting the potential of AI tools in education and the importance of hands-on learning and critical thinking. The results of thematic analysis agree with that AI allowed students to more efficiently engage in metacognition. The article concludes with a discussion on the implications of using AI in education and the need for continued exploration and assessment of their impact on student learning and success, for example, AI-human collaboration, scaffolding support for AI-incorporated education, and students' expectation for reliance on instructors. Overall, the study course provides a case study of a novel integration of emerging AI tools and education in biomedical informatics, showcasing the potential for personalized and efficient learning experiences.<br><br><b>Keywords: AI-incorporated Education; ChatGPT; Teaching and Learning; College Education<br> <br><h2>Links</h2>[<a href="pdfs/1570918754.pdf">Full text PDF</a>][<a href="bib/1570918754.bib">Bibtex</a>] <br> </html>
