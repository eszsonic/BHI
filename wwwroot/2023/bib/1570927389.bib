ABSTRACT    = {Functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI/sMRI) are
extensively used modalities for studying brain development. While
individual modalities may overlook crucial aspects of brain analysis,
combining multiple modalities allows us to leverage the benefits of
revealing hidden brain connections. To analyze multivariate change patterns
in brain function and structure with increasing age across the entire
brain, we employ a symmetric multimodal fusion approach that combines
multiset canonical correlation analysis  and joint independent component
analysis. In this study, we present a novel approach to analyze linked
longitudinal change patterns in functional network connectivity (FNC) and
gray matter (GM) data derived from the large-scale Adolescent Brain and
Cognitive Development dataset. Our approach uncovers significant pattern
changes in both modalities. Specifically, we identify highly structured
functional change patterns and structural change patterns that include
increased brain functional connectivity between the visual and sensorimotor
domains in the fMRI data, as well as changes in the bilateral sensorimotor
cortex in the sMRI data. Overall, our study demonstrates the strength of
our approach in uncovering longitudinal changes in FNC and GM, provides
valuable insights into the dynamic nature of brain connectivity and
structure during adolescence, and sheds light on potential gender-related
differences in these processes.},
