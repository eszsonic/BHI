ABSTRACT    = {Accurate and continuous monitoring of arterial blood pressure (ABP) is
vital for clinical hemodynamic monitoring. However, current methods are
either invasive, requiring insertion of catheters, or provide limited
information, lacking comprehensive ABP waveforms. Cuffless wearable
solutions, combined with deep learning, offer potential but face challenges
in accurately reconstructing ABP waveforms and estimating systolic and
diastolic blood pressure (SBP/DBP) due to individual variability. We
propose a novel custom pre-trained backbone and a tailored optimization
function to address these challenges. Our method demonstrates superior
performance in ABP waveform reconstruction and accurate SBP/DBP
estimations, while significantly reducing subject variance. To validate the
effectiveness of our approach, we conducted comprehensive evaluations using
both in-clinic data and a pioneering study involving remote health
monitoring with cuffless data. Our results surpass previous efforts,
demonstrating a root mean square error (RMSE) of 5.41 ± 1.35 mmHg and a
minimum of 58\% lower standard deviation (SD) across all measurements.
These outcomes highlight the robustness and precision of our method in
accurately estimating SBP/DBP and reconstructing ABP waveforms.
Furthermore, we assessed the performance of our solution in non-clinical
settings using the CTRAL BioZ dataset. The evaluation yielded an RMSE of
8.66 ± 1.13 mmHg for ABP, proving the potential of ABP reconstruction
under remote health settings.},
