ABSTRACT    = {Shift work disrupts sleep and causes chronic stress, resulting in burnout
syndrome characterized by emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and
decreased personal accomplishment. Continuous biometric data collected
through wearable devices contributes to mental health research. However,
direct prediction of burnout risk is still limited, and interpreting
machine learning models in healthcare poses challenges. In this paper, we
develop machine learning models that utilize wearable and survey data,
including rhythm features, to predict burnout risk among shift workers.
Additionally, we employ the DiCE (Diverse Counterfactual Explanations)
framework to generate interpretable explanations for the ML model, aiding
in the management of burnout risks. Our experiments on the AMED dataset
show that incorporating rhythm features significantly enhances the
predictive performance of our models. Specifically, sleep and heart rate
features have emerged as significant indicators for accurately predicting
burnout risk.},
