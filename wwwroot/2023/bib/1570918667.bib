ABSTRACT    = {Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have made promising improvements in
automatic medical image segmentation. However, they show limitations in
modeling long-range dependency due to the intrinsic locality properties of
convolution kernel. Transformer, which is notable for its ability of global
context modeling, has been used to remedy the shortcomings of CNN and break
its dominance in medical image segmentation. The self-attention module is
both memory and computational inefficient, so many methods choose to build
their Transformer branch upon largely downsampled feature maps or adopt the
tokenized image patches to fit their model into accessible GPUs. This
patch-wise operation restricts the network in extracting pixel-level
intrinsic structural or dependencies inside each patch, hurting the
performance of pixel-level classification tasks. To tackle these issues, we
design a memory- and computation-efficient self-attention module to enable
reasoning on relatively high-resolution features, promoting the efficiency
of learning global information while effective grasping fine spatial
details. Furthermore, we design a novel Multi-Branch Transformer
architecture to provide hierarchical features for handling objects with
variable shapes and sizes in medical images. By building four parallel
Transformer branches on different levels of CNN, our hybrid network
aggregates both multi-scale global contexts and multi-scale local features.
Extensive experiments on two medical image datasets with different
modalities demonstrate the superiority and generality of our proposed
network. We also conducted exhaustive experiments to demonstrate the
effectiveness of our motivation and the architecture design.},
