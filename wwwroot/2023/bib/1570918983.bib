ABSTRACT    = {Wound healing is a complex biological process characterized by intricate
cellular and molecular interactions. Understanding the underlying
mechanisms and the effects of different biological entities, such as genes,
proteins, and medications, on the cellular and biological functions of
wound healing is of paramount importance for developing effective
therapeutic interventions. In this paper, we present a text-mining approach
aimed to explore and unravel the complex regulatory relationships of genes,
proteins, and medications with the biological mechanisms of wound healing.
Our approach relies on a set of predefined dependency rules to identify and
capture the relationships between biological entities and their target
functions. By leveraging advanced AI technology like Generative Pre-trained
Transformer 4 (GPT-4), also known as ChatGPT, we evaluate the accuracy and
quality of the extracted relations. We also present a thorough discussion
about the encouraging preliminary results that validate the efficacy of our
model. Our dependency rule-based text-mining approach, combined with the
capabilities of GPT-4, presents a promising avenue for unraveling the
complex web of interactions involved in wound healing. The study
underscores the future potential of incorporating multi-word concept
embedding of complex functional entities and exploiting synthetic data from
GPT-4 for enhanced relation identification. This research offers a new
contribution to aid computational biology research by exploiting the power
of large language models to facilitate biological text analysis.},
