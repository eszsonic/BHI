ABSTRACT    = {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
(ADHD) are both neurodevelopmental conditions that produce social
interaction and executive functioning challenges but require very different
therapeutic strategies. For that reason, early and accurate differentiation
is important. However, their heterogeneity and overlap in symptoms make ASD
and ADHD difficult to differentiate. The current diagnostic procedure to
detect and distinguish ASD and ADHD is lengthy as it involves a
comprehensive medical, developmental, and behavioral assessment. A more
accessible and faster screening tool is needed to avoid delays in
treatment. There is evidence that some retinal responses captured by the
electroretinogram (ERG) are reduced in ASD subjects compared to
neurotypicals whereas an opposite trend has been reported in ADHD, making
ERG a promising tool for differentiating ASD and ADHD. However, previous
ERG analyses based on amplitude and timing of ERG waves have exhibited
limited success in differentiating ASD and ADHD. Recently, it has been
found that time-varying spectral analysis of ERG allows for more accurate
ASD detection compared to time-domain analysis. In this study, we evaluated
the feasibility of differentiation of ASD and ADHD using features obtained
by decomposing ERG using variable frequency complex demodulation (VFCDM).
We used VFCDM features to train machine learning models and evaluated them
using a subject independent validation approach. We achieved a maximum
accuracy of 84\% accuracy (87\% sensitivity, 79\% specificity),
outperforming previous studies using ERG. Features from higher frequencies
were found to be more important than features from lower frequencies.},
