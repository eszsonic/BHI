ABSTRACT    = {For artificial intelligence (AI) systems to be adopted in high stake
human-oriented applications, they must be able to make complex decisions in
an understandable and interpretable manner. While AI systems today have
grown leaps and bounds in predictive power using larger datasets with more
complex architectures, existing models remain ineffective at generating
interpretable insights in the clinical setting. In this paper, we address
the challenge of discovering interpretable insights from the clinical text
for disease prediction. For this purpose, we apply the clinical notes from
the electronic health records (EHR) available in the Medical Information
Mart of Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) dataset, which are labeled with the
international classification of diseases (ICD9) codes. Our proposed
algorithm combines interpretable text-based features with a novel pattern
discovery and disentanglement algorithm. Specifically, our approach
encompasses the following: (1) uncovering strong association patterns
between clinical notes and diseases, (2) surpassing baseline clustering
algorithms in effectively distinguishing between disease clusters, and (3)
demonstrating comparable performance to baseline supervised methods in
predicting diseases. Our results validate the model's capability to strike
a balance between interpretability and outcome prediction accuracy. By
unveiling insightful patterns between clinical notes and diseases, our
approach upholds a reasonable level of diagnostic accuracy.},
