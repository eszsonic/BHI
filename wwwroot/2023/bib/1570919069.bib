ABSTRACT    = {Fluid resuscitation is a medical intervention commonly used in hypovolemic
scenarios to compensate for the lost blood volume and stabilize critically
ill patients. Fluid management is currently ad-hoc and dependent on the
physician's style and expertise. Such ad-hoc protocols lack the capability
of accurately adjusting the fluid infusion dosages due to their empiric
nature, especially in the presence of clinical disturbances, posing
significant risk of adverse effects such as under- and over-dosing. Thus,
treatment performance is compromised due to the lack of appropriate dosage
adjustment tools available. This paper presents a novel modeling framework
namely, robust nonlinear state space modeling (RNSSM), for predicting
hemodynamic responses in hemorrhage resuscitation. The proposed approach
innovatively integrates autoencoder learning and variational Gaussian
inference (VGI) in a unified framework to develop nonlinear state space
models that are highly amenable to the closed-loop control design from
limited, noisy critical care data. The goal is to develop subject-specific
models that can reliably predict mean arterial pressure (MAP) in response
to fluid infusion in hemorrhage scenarios. The RNSSM approach aim to
improve (1) model accuracy by considering subject-specific characteristics
and drug attributes and (2) model reliability by accounting for
uncertainties that inherently exist in clinical data. Enabling reliable,
personalized hemodynamic models amenable to the closed-loop control design
can potentially lead to development of efficient model-informed precision
dosing strategies, promoting patient safety and outcomes in critical care.},
