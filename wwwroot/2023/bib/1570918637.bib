ABSTRACT    = {Effective prevention and management of diabetes relies on maintaining a
normal blood glucose level, thus avoiding abnormal events such as
hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia. Predicting anomalous events beforehand can
potentially help patients and caregivers intervene to prevent such events
through modifiable behaviors such as exercise, diet, and medication.
Although Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM) sensors have been used to monitor
and forecast blood glucose level, current research lacks a computational
approach that recommends a behavioral intervention to bring the glucose
level to a normal range. To address this shortcoming, we present GlySim, a
CGM simulator that uses multimodal data to not only forecast future glucose
readings but also enable a user to examine the impacts of behavior change
on glucose response in advance. GlySim creates opportunities for change in
food consumption, medication, and physical activity to avoid dysglycemia by
pinpointing factors that cause anomalous events using Grad-CAM
(Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) and allowing users to observe
how adjusting a behavioral factor changes glucose trajectories. We validate
GlySim on a dataset of 10 patients with type 1 diabetes and achieve an
overall mean absolute error (MAE) as low as 16.5 mg/dl in simulating
glycemic response. Furthermore, Glysim detects hyperglycemic events with
0.89 average precision.},
