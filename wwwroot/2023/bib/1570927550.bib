ABSTRACT    = {This paper presents a novel client-edge-cloud-based framework that
integrates the learning of task-invariant ECG feature representations from
ultra-short ECG segments ($<$10 sec) and subsequent training of
task-specific machine learning (ML) classifiers for different applications.
Our proposed framework removes the need for application-specific ECG
processing by training a general ECG representation learner in a
self-supervised manner. The ECG representation learner is then used for
generating feature inputs for the different task-specific applications. The
proposed framework distributes the computation across cloud, edge, and
client components depending on the resource requirement and time
criticality. We demonstrate the feasibility and promise of the proposed
approach on two different applications, that is, acute stress type
classification, and biometric user identification and authentication. The
use cases were analyzed using the computational parameters for the
different models and computational tasks along with the overall
performance. Our analyses show that the application-specific ML models can
perform real-time inference in less than a second and the training time of
the ML classifiers at the edge devices are in the order of 10-20 seconds.
In the future, the proposed framework can be utilized for developing
reliable, secure, and multi-functional ECG-based smart systems.},
