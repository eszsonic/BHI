ABSTRACT    = {The advent of mobile ubiquitous computing enabled sensor informatics of
human movements leveraged to model and build deep learning classifiers for
cognitive AI. Expanding deep learning approaches for classifying
instrumented hand manipulation tasks, especially the art of manual therapy
and soft tissue manipulation, can potentially augment practitioner's
performance and enhance fidelity with computer assisted guidelines. This
paper introduces a dataset of 3D force profiles and manipulation motion
sequences of controlled soft tissue manipulation stroke pattern
applications in thoracolumbar, upper thigh and calf regions of a human
subject performed by five experienced manual therapists. The multimodal 3D
force, 3D accelerometer and gyro raw data were preprocessed and
experimentally fed into a multilayer Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) deep learning model to observe sequence
classifications of two manipulation motion techniques (Linear
{"}Strumming{"} motion and curvilinear {"}J-Stroke{"} arched motion) of
manual therapy performed using a handheld, localizing Quantifiable Soft
Tissue Manipulation (QSTM) medical tool. Each of these motion sequences
were further labeled with corresponding best practice technique from
validated video tapes and reclassified into {"}Correct{"} and
{"}Incorrect{"} practice based on defined criteria. The deep learning model
resulted in 90-95\% classification accuracy for individual intra-therapist
reduced dataset. The classification accuracy varied in between 74\%-89\%
range, when trained with variable feature set combinations for the complete
spectrum of inter-therapist dataset. 
Clinical Relevance-AI guided online practice classifications can be
leveraged to curb practice inconsistencies, optimize training using data
informed guidelines, and study progression of pain and healing towards
advancing manual therapy.},
