ABSTRACT    = {Noninvasive monitoring of cardiovascular health plays a crucial role in
predicting risks and reducing mortality rates, especially in the context of
trauma care. The seismocardiogram (SCG) in particular is a noninvasive
signal that has been shown to monitor key health parameters related to
blood volume loss estimation, suggesting its ability to guide trauma care
intervention. Robust extraction of features from SCG signals in noisy
environments is challenging due to low signal-to-noise (SNR) ratios. In
addition, lack of access to clean ground truth signals makes developing
denoising algorithms even more difficult. In this work, we propose a novel
deep learning-based approach for denoising SCG signals without requiring
access to clean ground truth signals. Experimental results showed (1)
enhancement in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) (approximately 10 dB and 9
dB increase for AO and AC regions of -10 dB SNR beats respectively), and
(2) improvements in feature extraction accuracy (approximately 3x and 1.5x
for AO and AC features of -10 dB SNR beats respectively) using the
denoising model. Thus, the model effectively reduces noise, and improves
the quality of SCG signals, leading to improved accuracy in feature
extraction in noisy environments. This is a promising step forward in
improving the quality and utility of SCG signals for clinical and research
purposes.},
