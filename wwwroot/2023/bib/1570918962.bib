ABSTRACT    = {There is a well-established association between sleep and health status,
but the current gold-standard for analysing sleep, polysomnography, is too
disruptive and expensive to enable longitudinal monitoring. There is,
therefore, a growing interest in automated sleep scoring, or staging, using
a combination of wearable technology to acquire cardio-respiratory vital
signs and machine learning to learn how these vital signs vary with sleep
state. However, sleep and the associated cardio-respiratory signals also
change significantly with age, in part because of age-related changes in
the autonomic nervous system, and this impacts the accuracy of wearable
sleep staging methods. This paper investigates how the accuracy of a deep
neural network model trained on the Sleep Heart Health Study database
varies with the age of the subject. We show that the classification
accuracy for each sleep stage decreases with age. We also present
proof-of-concept analysis of longitudinal sleep data from a COVID-19
Challenge Study with a younger cohort (18 - 29 years of age), and discusses
the impact of having trained the deep neural network model on a database
with an age range from 40 to 89+ and suggest how this issue may be
addressed.

Clinical Relevance - This paper highlights how changes in sleep behaviour
with age can affect neural network sleep staging using cardio-respiratory
vital signs and machine learning, resulting in less accurate sleep staging
in some age groups, and discusses potential methods for addressing this.},
