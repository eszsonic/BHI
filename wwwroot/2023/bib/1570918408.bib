ABSTRACT    = {Early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is crucial, yet predicting AD
in the mild cognitive impairment stage remains challenging. Integrating
biological data from genomics and neuroimaging can provide valuable
insights into early detection and treatment. Although recent deep learning
studies have shown promise in AD prediction tasks, they often lack the
interpretation of multimodal data interactions. Therefore, there is a need
for further research on deep learning methods that can effectively
integrate and interpret multimodal biological data for AD diagnosis and
prediction.
This study proposes a novel approach for identifying regions where
interactions occur in sMRI (structural MRI) and genetic information and for
detecting discriminative features in AD progression. Through the use of an
attention mechanism and contrastive loss, it effectively models the
inter-relationships between these modalities, leading to a more accurate
understanding of AD. Our proposed method achieved remarkable performance,
with an accuracy of 92\%. Additionally, through model interpretation, we
were able to identify genetic and brain feature associations in AD
progression. This study provides a interpretable approach to AD prediction
by integrating imaging and genetic data. By capturing the interplay between
imaging and genetic data, the model provides valuable clinical
interpretations and enhances its predictive capabilities. This integration
also enables the identification of critical biomarkers and signatures for
early detection and intervention in AD.},
