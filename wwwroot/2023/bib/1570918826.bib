ABSTRACT    = {We investigate AR-based tracking and registration of the liver surface for
potential surgical applications. Our approach consists of streaming RGBD
data from a Hololens2 device, RGBD segmentation using a deep learning model
and registering the acquired partial liver surface point cloud with the
corresponding virtual liver model. We aim to derive basic requirements for
AR-guided liver surgery, thus consider several test cases of partially
occluded liver as it would appear in surgical scenarios. To evaluate our
approach, we use a 3D-printed phantom with basic texture and rigid
structure. 
Our results show that the visible liver section has a substantial impact of
feature extraction and matching, thus the registration process. Test cases,
where specific anatomical features are visible, e.g. the right liver lobe,
yielded superior outcomes compared to other cases, e.g. only the left liver
lobe visible. Moreover, our results showed that large scale Hololens
movements during the tracking process affected the registration
performance. Our implementation achieved 2-3 frames per second for tracking
and registration. We discuss the potential and limitations of utilizing
Hololens2 for real-time tracking and registration of the liver surface. To
our knowledge this is the first experimental approach for real-time
markerless tracking and registration for AR-guided surgery guidance using
the Hololens2 sensors only.},
