ABSTRACT    = {Automatic segmentation of knee bony anatomy is essential in orthopedics,
and it has been around for several years in both pre-operative and
post-operative settings. While deep learning algorithms have demonstrated
exceptional performance in medical image analysis, the assessment of
fairness and potential biases within these models remains limited. Our
study revisited implementation of deep learning in knee bony anatomy
segmentation of plain radiographs to uncover gender and racial biases and
implement strategies for bias mitigation. Within the multiple models we
implemented, we found that different bias mitigation strategies present a
compromise between fairness and accuracy of predicted knee anatomy
segmentation. Optimizing a deep learning model that can fairly account for
racial and gender bias in interpretation of knee plain radiographs has
significant implications in several areas. The proposed mitigation
strategies mitigate gender and racial biases, ensuring fair and unbiased
segmentation results. We found that racial and gender bias can be present
in knee bony anatomy segmentation models, but that bias mitigation
strategies can be effectively implemented. The current contribution offers
the potential to advance our understanding of biases, and it provides
practical insights for researchers and practitioners in medical imaging.
Furthermore, this work promotes equal access to accurate diagnoses and
treatment outcomes for diverse patient populations, fostering equitable and
inclusive healthcare provision.},
