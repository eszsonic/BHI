ABSTRACT    = {Biclustering is a data driven technique that can reveal two dimensional
clusters (sub matrices) in a matrix. This technique overcomes one of the
main disadvantages of clustering, which is finding global patterns, but
failing to find local patterns. It has been widely used in the field of
bioinformatics to find similarly expressed genes (highly expressed or
repressed genes) in a gene expression matrix. When applied onto structural
MRI (sMRI), where it's a quite new concept, it can reveal novel
perspectives such as subgroups within a group of subjects suffering from a
disease. N-BiC is one such biclustering algorithm based on an exhaustive
N-component search. The algorithm is a recursive Depth First Search, which
can be less efficient, resource intensive and time consuming over iterative
approaches. It is also dependent on the search arrangement and hence
permutation is needed to explore and merge the potential biclusters. In
this work, we have improved the N-BiC method by comparing each bicluster
with rest of the biclusters, which decreases the algorithmic run time and
eliminating the permutation step. Based on iteratively deepening Depth
First Search, Modified N-BiC performs similar to N-BiC and requires less
memory, making it possible to run it on a device with modest specifications},
