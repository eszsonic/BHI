ABSTRACT    = {Visual inspection, along with physical examination, is the traditional
method to assess burns. However, burn-care providers have different levels
of experience and may face challenges in assessing the depth and severity
of the wounds. The  challenges associated with the traditional approach,
such as poor and varying diagnosis/prognosis accuracy, have inspired
researchers towards automated burn assessment to ensure effective burn
wound management. The current research aims to improve automatic burn wound
assessment. It provides an ordered scoring scale to measure burn severity
using four characteristics: inflammation, scar, uniformity, and
pigmentation. The research also proposes an attention-based Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) model to assess the characteristics of burn wounds.
The model is evaluated with 2D color images to assess levels of
inflammation, scar, uniformity, and pigmentation with two different
datasets, and the performances are compared with other models. The
attention mechanism of the deep learning model selectively focuses on
salient parts of the image to improve the understanding of the visual
structure and enhance the classification accuracy. The proposed work
outperforms most prior related work, achieving 93\% in average accuracy.
Clinical relevance - This research has significant clinical relevance in
assisting accurate, reliable, and on-time diagnosis, treatment, and
follow-up of burn wounds and thereby, provides effective burn wound
management.},
