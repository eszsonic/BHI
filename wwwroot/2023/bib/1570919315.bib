ABSTRACT    = {Hand impairments resulting from neurological conditions can significantly
affect individuals' quality of life. Home-based rehabilitation programs are
promising solutions to address these challenges. This study investigated
user engagement with MusicGlove, a commercially available wearable grip
sensor. We applied deep learning and machine learning techniques to
classify users based on their interaction with the device. We categorized
users into 'low', 'moderate', and 'power' users and found considerable
differences in device usage. For user adherence prediction after one day of
device usage, we used a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) deep learning model
and traditional machine learning models such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN),
Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Logistic Regression. The MLP model
outperformed other models, achieving an average F1-score of 0.68 in cross
validation and a balanced performance on unseen test data with an accuracy
of 0.68, precision of 0.66, recall of 0.72, and an F1-score of 0.69 for the
'Low' user class. Our results underscore the need for personalized
home-based rehabilitation programs and highlight the effective use of deep
learning algorithms in predicting user adherence in home-based digital
rehabilitation. This study contributes to the growing body of evidence
supporting machine learning applications in healthcare, particularly in
patient outcome prediction and treatment personalization.},
