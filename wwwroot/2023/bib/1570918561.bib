ABSTRACT    = {The diagnosis and assessment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
(ADHD) in clinical practice heavily rely on subjective and biased scales.
This study explores the feasibility of using actigraphy measurements to
objectively assess and monitor the treatment response of ADHD in children
receiving medication. A cohort of ten children underwent evaluation using
three scales, one administered by child-adolescent psychiatrists and two
completed by the parents, both pre- and post-medication. In addition, two
sets of actigraphy recordings were collected, each spanning seven
consecutive days, before and after medication administration. The study
revealed that changes in the median, mean, and skewness of accelerations in
spherical coordinates exhibited stronger correlations with changes in the
scale scores in comparison to other features. Additionally, binary
classifications using feature sets with top correlations and PCA features
defining 95\% variability showed better predictions for ADHD treatment
response assessed by TURGAY DSM-IV-S (82\%) and WFIRS-life skills (81.4\%)
scores compared to WFIRS-school behavior (63.9\%) scores. These findings
represent the first reported correlations between ADHD scales and a broad
range of features. Additionally, they demonstrate the feasibility of using
actigraphy data to predict ADHD treatment response for the first time.

Clinical Relevance- The utilization of actigraphy for objective and
reliable measurement of ADHD symptoms and functional impairment can serve
as a valuable complement to subjective evaluations conducted by parents and
clinicians, and thus aiding in determining an effective treatment plan and
identifying priority areas for intervention.},
