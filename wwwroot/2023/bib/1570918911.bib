ABSTRACT    = {Early screening of handwriting difficulties is key to start remediation
activities that help distinguishing between a simple delay and dysgraphia.
Technology is fundamental in this process, as also claimed by guidelines
for dysgraphia diagnosis: it allows to implement artificial intelligence
techniques to help in the discrimination of the difficulty. To this end, a
serious game was leveraged to assess handwriting laws altered in dysgraphia
starting from symbols drawing. 66 first and second graders were
longitudinally tested both with the serious game and with a handwriting
proficiency test. Objective features computed from the game were tested to
understand if they significantly differed between children at risk and not
at risk of dysgraphia, according to a standardized clinical test used to
assess handwriting. Then, machine learning models were leveraged to predict
the risk and understand the areas of difficulty. On average, 62\% of the
features significantly differ between risk levels for first graders, whilst
only 35\% for second graders, thus revealing a better sensitivity in
younger children. This is encouraging for an early observation. As for
machine learning, a Logistic classifier was able to predict risk with an
area under the precision-recall curve of 0.84 for the risk class and 0.98
for the non-risk class. The results of this study could be a valid help for
an artificial intelligence-enhanced screening of dysgraphia.},
