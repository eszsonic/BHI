ABSTRACT    = {Non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type of lung cancer
and could be classified into two main histological subtypes: adenocarcinoma
and squamous cell carcinoma. The identification of the histological subtype
is a crucial step in the diagnosis of NSCLC. RNA sequencing data hold
valuable biological information but may contain missing gene expression
counts, which limit their potential exploitation in practice. In this work,
we address the issue of missing gene expression data in NSCLC histological
subtype prediction from RNA sequencing. To this end, we propose a pipeline
based on the generative adversarial imputation network (GAIN) for the
generation of plausible imputations of missing data and tree-based ensemble
models for NSCLC histological subtype prediction. We adopted a nested cross
validation scheme for the evaluation of the classification models. The
proposed pipeline exhibited an outstanding performance with an area under
the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.98 ± 0.03 and an accuracy
of 0.96 ± 0.05 obtained with the Light Gradient Boosting Machine.
Experimental results showed that GAIN-derived imputations are useful to
boost classification performance. Finally, we used the Shapley Additive
Explanations technique and found a set of genes that were the most relevant
for NSCLC subtyping across different models.},
