ABSTRACT    = {The Few-Shot Learning (FSL) method is enhancing the field of Natural
Language Processing (NLP) by requiring only a small amount of labeled data
to achieve significant improvements. The supervised models usually need a
huge amount of annotated data to train and are computationally expensive.
However, the annotation process is difficult and time-consuming for
clinical data that exists in large-scale electronic health records (EHRs)
and online posts, where only specialists with professional clinical
knowledge could annotate them manually. On the other hand, fine-tuning
Pretrained Language Model (PLM) always has poor performance on few-shot
training data. Thus, we have introduced a novel FSL technique named SiaKey,
which utilizes Siamese Networks, and integrates Keyphrases Extraction and
Domain Knowledge. The task of post-classification is challenging since
online posts typically contain a greater amount of irrelevant information
compared to traditional EHRs. We tested Siakey including 5, 10, 15, and
20-shot learning on health-related online post-classification tasks. The
results of our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our Siakey in
capturing text features, and indicate superior performance compared to
BioBERT on similar FSL tasks. This paper introduces a novel and efficient
approach to automatically identify patients' disease trajectories based on
their clinical descriptions and provides inspiration for other related NLP
tasks.},
