ABSTRACT    = {Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an essential visualizing tool in the
diagnosis and monitoring of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) disease. However, the
neurological examinations and the MRI assessments are insufficient to
provide personalized treatment to the patients due to the complexity of the
disease. This study implemented an explainable artificial intelligence (AI)
model with embedded rules to assess MS disease evolution. Clinical data
were used including demographic and neurological measurements. Texture
features were extracted from manually delineated and normalized brain MRI
lesions. Statistical analysis was employed to select the statistically
significant texture features and clinical data. Different models using
machine learning algorithms were implemented to differentiate the subjects
diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) from the subjects with
progressive MS (PMS). Argumentation-based reasoning was performed by
modifying the rules extracted from models with the best evaluation results.
The findings indicated that the proposed explainable AI model can predict
the clinical conditions of MS disease with high accuracy and provide
transparent and understandable explanations with high fidelity. Future work
will include further clinical data such as medications, and investigate the
correlation of the texture features and clinical data with the neurological
impairment. The proposed model should also be evaluated on more MS
subjects.},
