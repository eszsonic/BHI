ABSTRACT    = {Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death worldwide.
Patients with CVD may also suffer from mental disorders, such as,
depression which is a common comorbid condition. However, the risk factors
for depression in CVD patients have not been extensively investigated in
the literature. In this work, we utilized a hybrid and explainable
AI-empowered workflow to identify underlying factors for CVD and
depression. Towards this direction, we acquired a subset of the UK Biobank
(UKB), including 157,302 patients with depression assessment and CVD. At
the first step, 701 features were selected from the UKB, upon clinical
guidance, including demographics, blood tests, mental examinations, and
clinical assessments. An automated biobank data curation pipeline was
applied to transform the UKB subset into a high-quality dataset by removing
outliers, and genes with increased variability. A hybrid version of the
XGBoost classifier was used to classify patients with CVD and depression,
where a scalable loss function was utilized to overcome overfitting
effects. Our results demonstrate that we can diagnose patients with
comorbid conditions of CVD and depression with 0.80, 0.82, accuracy, and
sensitivity, respectively, where the mood swings, BMI, and age, were
identified as biomarkers, among others. To our knowledge, this is the first
case study aiming to distil knowledge from the UKB to identify cost
effective risk factors for patients with CVD and depression.},
