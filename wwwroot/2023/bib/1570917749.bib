ABSTRACT    = {Intravascular Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) has emerged as a powerful
imaging modality for assessing the morphological characteristics of
coronary arteries. Quantification of calcified coronary arteries from OCT
images is crucial for evaluating the severity and progression of coronary
artery disease. However, in current practice, OCT images are interpreted
manually which is time-consuming, subjective, and prone to inter- and
intra-observer variability. To address these limitations, we propose a
framework for automated quantification of calcified coronary arteries from
OCT images. By leveraging deep learning techniques, the proposed framework
automatically segments lumen and calcified plaque from OCT images.
Subsequently, comprehensive morphological analysis of lumen and calcified
plaque is performed using advanced image processing algorithms, allowing
for retrieval of various dimensions of corresponding structures. Following
that, essential shape measurements are derived to ensure adequate
characterization of calcified coronary arteries. The efficacy of the
proposed framework was validated on a clinical dataset. Extensive
experiments have demonstrated high accuracy and consistency of quantitative
results estimated by the proposed framework against manual analysis with
relative errors of less than 10\%. The proposed framework holds great
potential to extend its application to characterization of other
non-calcified plaques and arteries, aiding in clinical intervention and
translational research using OCT.},
