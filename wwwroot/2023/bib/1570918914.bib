ABSTRACT    = {The early detection of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is fundamental to
initiate treatments for delaying the onset of dementia. Currently, the Mini
Mental State Examination (MMSE) is one of the most common clinical scale
used by geriatricians to assess cognitive function. A deviation of 1 to 3
points from the maximum score (30) is considered as sign of relevant
cognitive decline. However, objective and affordable tools are needed to
complement the screening process. The quantitative analysis of handwriting
represents a suitable solution, as the gesture is significantly impaired in
MCI subjects in terms of time, speed, fluency and applied pressure. This
works presents the development and testing of classification models able to
separate subjects at risk of cognitive decline (MMSE <= 28) from controls
(MMSE > 28), starting from free-content handwriting data acquired with a
smart ink pen, used on paper, from which 36 indicators were computed. Data
were collected in 2 phases. The former involved 45 subjects and served for
models training. In the latter, data were acquired from 23 subjects in a
domestic longitudinal framework and were partially used for model
refinement, but mainly for testing. Three different algorithms were tried
(support vector machine, random forest and catboost) The best test
performances on the longitudinal data were obtained by a Catboost
classifier, achieving accuracy 93.33\%, precision 88.89\%, recall 100\% and
f1 score 94.12\%. The results support the use of computerized handwriting
analysis as screening tool for cognitive decline detection.},
