ABSTRACT    = {Various eye ailments associated with the posterior segment of the eye,
including age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and central serous
chorioretinopathy (CSCR), are caused due to dysfunction of the highly
vascular choroid layer. It is responsible for supplying oxygen and
nutrients to the retinal outer layers and maintaining the thermal
equilibrium of the eye. Clinicians hypothesize that detecting minute
volumetric structural changes of the choroidal vasculature enables early
diagnosis. To this end, recently introduced swept-source optical coherence
tomography (SS-OCT) volume scans provide dense high-resolution imaging of
the choroid. However, due to intricate structure, manual segmentation of
these vessels is not feasible and clinicians seek algorithmic segmentation
and attempts made earlier reported limited performance. In response, we
propose a method based on adaptive Phansalkar thresholding to accurately
detect choroidal vessels in OCT volumes. Specifically, it increases the
contrast between vessel and non-vessel regions within each subblock of the
B-Scan. On15 SS-OCT volumes of healthy and diseased subjects, we performed
subjective grading-based performance analysis on 2D and 3D vasculatures
achieving 92.67\% and 94\% segmentation accuracy, respectively. Further,
the proposed method demonstrated significant improvement over the
previously reported method. Finally, we envisage that this method provides
ground truth segmentation for training deep learning models.},
