ABSTRACT    = {Alzheimer's disease, marked by memory loss and cognitive decline, places a
significant burden on nations with aging populations. Precise survival
prediction for patients with Alzheimer's disease could guide disease
management strategies and enhance patient care. However, the utilization of
Electronic Health Records (EHR) for survival prediction often presents
challenges due to the interdisciplinary knowledge required to interpret the
clinical language within narrative notes. In this study, we introduce a
novel method for survival prediction in  patients with Alzheimer's disease
by utilizing a fine-tuned large language model, AD-GPT, trained
specifically on EHR data. AD-GPT, built on top of GPT-3, can not only
answer questions from general-purpose natural language, but also specialize
in survival prognosis from Alzheimer's disease-related EHR data. Our
proposed method is validated on a de-identified clinical cohort of 476
patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease for survival prediction. We
also compared the proposed method with a clinical model. With its superior
performance in survival prediction compared to related methods, AD-GPT
shows promising potential for more accurate prediction at an individual
level, aiding in the management and treatment of Alzheimer's disease. This
study also demonstrates how large language models may transfer their
general AI knowledge to potentially improve a specific clinical task.},
