ABSTRACT    = {Drug-Induced Liver Injury (DILI), liver damage caused by drugs, represents
a significant factor contributing to the failure of clinical trials.
Remarkably, the drug development process, which entails an extensive
timeline spanning several years and incurring costs of billions of dollars
to achieve FDA approval, could greatly benefit from early DILI prediction.
Furthermore, through the utilization of DILI prediction, clinicians can
obtain valuable insights into the potential risks associated with
medication, empowering them to make more informed decisions when
prescribing drugs to patients. We employed Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to
predict DILI based on drug structures. GNNs consist of node aggregation,
which gathers node representations, and graph pooling, which compiles node
representations to portray the graph as a single vector. The graph pooling
method built on Set Transformer outperforms existing techniques, but we
identified a limitation: Set Transformer, using a random seed vector as the
query vector, cannot differentiate between graphs of varied structures.
Moreover, it was found to potentially lack expressiveness, being randomly
defined without prior knowledge and relying on a limited number of seed
vectors. To overcome this issue, we introduced Molecular Transformer which
employs the unique molecular representation as the query vector. We found
that using drug toxicity information extracted from drug toxicity
knowledge-bases as the query vector yielded the best performance.},
