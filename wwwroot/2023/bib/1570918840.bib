ABSTRACT    = {Super-resolution is an important technique in various fields, particularly
in medical imaging, where it plays a crucial role in understanding and
analysis of complex, qualitative, and quantitative characteristics of
tissues at high resolutions.  However, obtaining high-resolution images
often faces practical limitations pertaining to acquisition device
limitations, patient motion, or longer acquisition times. The remarkable
success of deep learning methods has recently opened doors to their
application in image super-resolution tasks as well. These deep
learning-based methods heavily rely on a substantial amount of data, which
is often unavailable, especially in the case of Magnetic Resonance Imaging
(MRI) scans.
Particularly in magnetic Resonance super-resolution, it is often impossible
to have low-resolution and high-resolution training image pairs. To address
this, deep learning approaches simulate low-resolution images using many
image degradation methods mimicking low-resolution images to create
training image pairs from the available few high-resolution images.
However, models trained on specific degradation simulations exhibit bias,
leading to poor performance in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we
hypothesize that such deep learning models trained on specific training
image pairs with a specific degradation model are biased, we systematically
study such biases with different types of degradation, different deep
learning frameworks, and training losses.  Finally, we advocate ensuring
the diversity of degradation models to generate training image pairs
controls such biases resulting in a more robust learning framework for MR
image super-resolution.},
