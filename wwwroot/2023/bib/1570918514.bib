ABSTRACT    = {The global increase in elderly individuals has led to a rise in fragility
fractures and chronic aging-related diseases, including osteoporosis. In
this context, Deep Learning (DL) offers the potential to analyze bone
images to aid researchers and clinicians in studying its health starting
from the microscale. Previous studies demonstrate the effectiveness of DL
in segmenting lacunae and classifying bone tissue micro-states from
Synchrotron-Radiation micro-Computed Tomography (SR-microCT) images.
However, the generalizability of these models, the laborious work in
labeling tiny structures in high-dimensional images, and the low
inter-class variance in SR-microCT images remain a concern. To fill this
void, this paper proposes a Mask-Guided Attention (MGA) approach that
combines semi-supervised learning lacunae segmentation and attention
methods for healthy and osteoporotic SR-microCT image classification. In
particular, semi-supervised learning aims at reducing the number of labeled
images required during segmentation. At the same time, the MGA approach
exploits the pseudo-labels predicted to focus the network's attention on
the informative lacunar structures. Our strategy allows achieving up to
5.64\% and 12.17\% accuracy improvements over de-facto lacunae image
segmentation and image classification methods, as well as more
interpretable results.
Clinical relevance---The proposed MGA approach could enhance the
understanding of bone microscale phenomena by exploiting SR-microCT images,
supporting the study and the diagnosis of osteoporosis in individuals.},
