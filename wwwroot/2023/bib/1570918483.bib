ABSTRACT    = {Stress is related to short- and long-term alterations in stress systems,
including the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the sympathetic
nervous system (SNS). While it is well established that stress experienced
during the day can affect sleep quality, less is known about how it affects
stress systems during the night. We assume that stress coping strategies
can have an impact on how stress carries over into the night and that
individuals with bad coping mechanisms show elevated activation of stress
systems during sleep. For that reason, we recorded the heart rate (HR) and
heart rate variability (HRV) of 21 healthy participants on two consecutive
nights during sleep and the first hour after awakening, Additionally, we
extracted cortisol and alpha-amylase from saliva samples collected in the
first hour after awakening and assessed stress coping capabilities using
self-reports. To analyze the relationship between HR(V) parameters and
stress coping we performed backward stepwise regression models and trained
different machine learning-based regression algorithms to predict positive
(SVF\_Pos) and negative (SVF\_Neg) stress coping capabilities,
respectively. Our results show that individuals with higher SVF\_Neg scores
showed higher SNS activity during the night, whereas higher SVF\_Pos scores
indicated lower SNS activity. SVF\_Pos was predicted with a mean absolute
error (MAE) of 1.51±0.73 and SVF\_Neg with an MAE of 2.79±1.53. Our
findings indicate an association between nightly HR(V) and the individual's
capability of coping with stress. This provides further information about
how stress influences sleep and might be used for tailored intervention and
feedback on successful stress coping.},
