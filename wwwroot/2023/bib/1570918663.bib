ABSTRACT    = {The diagnosis of breast cancer has a significant impact on a patient's
quality of life. Several demographic and clinical factors have been
reported to affect the quality of life of breast cancer patients. However,
few studies have a sufficient sample size for multifactorial assays to be
tested. In the present work, we explore a rich set of clinical,
psychological, socio-demographic, and lifestyle data from a large
multicenter study of breast cancer patients (n = 765), with the aim to
predict their global quality of life (QoL) 18 months after the diagnosis
and to identify possible QoL-related prognostic factors. For QoL
prediction, a set of Machine Learning methods were explored, namely Random
Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
Depending on the model used, prediction accuracy varied between 0.305 and
0.864. Across models, a largely common set of psychological characteristics
(optimism, perceived ability to deal with trauma, resilience as a trait,
ability to understand the disease), as well as subjective perceptions of
personal functionality (physical, social, cognitive function), were
identified as key prognostic factors of long-term quality of life after a
breast cancer diagnosis.

Clinical Relevance- Predicting QoL is critical for decision-making on
cancer care. Early detection of protective and obstructive factors
associated with patient well-being would help health professionals to
tailor preventive psychological programs aimed at enhancing the ability of
breast cancer patients to adapt effectively to the disease.},
