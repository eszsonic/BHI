ABSTRACT    = {Irregular sampling of time series in electronic health records (EHRs)
presents a challenge for the development of machine learning models.
Additionally, the pattern of missing data in certain clinical variables is
not random, but depends on the decisions of clinicians and the state of the
patient. Point process is a mathematical framework for analyzing event
sequence data that is consistent with irregular sampling patterns. To
tackle the challenges posed by EHRs, we propose a transformer event encoder
with point process loss that encodes the pattern of laboratory tests in
EHRs. We conduct experiments on two real-world EHR databases to evaluate
our proposed approach. Firstly, we learn the transformer event encoder
jointly with an existing state encoder in a self-supervised learning
approach which gives superior performance in negative log-likelihood and
future event prediction. Additionally, we propose an algorithm for
aggregating attention weights that can reveal the interaction between the
events. Secondly, we transfer and freeze the learned transformer event
encoder to the downstream task for the outcome prediction (mortality and
sepsis shock), where it outperforms state-of-the-art models for handling
irregularly-sample time series. Our results demonstrate that our approach
can improve representation learning in EHRs and can be useful for clinical
prediction tasks.},
