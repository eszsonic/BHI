ABSTRACT    = {Radar-based human activity recognition has opened up new opportunities in
the design of cyber-physical systems
(CPS) for health and safety by providing an ambient, non-contact,
non-intrusive way to monitor human movement at
any time of the day (24/7). This is important because it can enable the
development of RF-based techniques for the early
diagnosis and post-treatment monitoring of ailments resulting in symptoms
impacting gait, as well as in improving ageing-
in-place and quality life by providing gait-based assessments of fall risk
- all in a home environment, where the person
monitored would be moving in a natural fashion while doing daily
activities. As such, it can provide a more realistic
assessment of human mobility and gait, where quantitative gait analysis
(QGA) methods are often unavailable and a person
may not necessarily be walking in this same way as one does outside a
doctor's office. Moreover, RF technologies have have
the potential to improve the accessibility of care while also reducing
healthcare costs. This paper presents a novel framework for human pose
estimation using millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar technology, focusing on
personalized healthcare applications. The proposed framework utilizes
range-azimuth, range-elevation, and range-Doppler maps as inputs to a
convolutional neural network (CNN) with a long short-term memory (LSTM)
architecture to capture temporal dependencies and achieve improved skeleton
estimation. Furthermore, this paper addresses the limitations of current
radar-based skeleton estimation techniques, such as inconsistent kinematics
and reliance on sparse radar point clouds. Skeleton estimation accuracy
attained using diversified simulations is compared with that achieved real
RF data, as validated using gold standard Vicon motion capture (MoCap)
measurements as ground truth. The results highlight the potential of mmWave
radar-based human skeleton estimation for advancing personalized healthcare
and improving gait analysis and fall risk assessment.},
