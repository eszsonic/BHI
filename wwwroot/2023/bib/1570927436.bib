ABSTRACT    = {Common treatments in Intensive Care Units are distressing and involve
prolonged sedation. Maintaining adequate sedation levels is challenging and
is prone to errors such as incorrect dosing, omission or delay of
sedatives, and administering the wrong sedative. In this study, we applied
a reinforcement learning (RL) approach to retrospective data, developing a
sedation management agent. The agent's goal is to maintain an adequate
level of sedation while also keeping the Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) as an
indicator of the vital sign of the patients in the safe therapeutic range.
While most of the prior work has focused on a specific medication -
propofol - which has no intrinsic analgesic effect and must be
co-administered with an opioid or other analgesics for ICU patients, in
this work, we build a recommender system to find the optimal concurrent
dosage regimen for three commonly used sedatives(propofol and midazolam)
and opioid(fentanyl). To mitigate the potential risk of delirium and the
adverse effects of over sedation, we integrated a delirium control variable
into the reward function. The results indicate that our approach
successfully recommends sedative dosages by improving the maintenance of
the patients' target sedative level by 29\\% compared to the clinicians'
policy.},
