ABSTRACT    = {This article presents a case study on the integration of AI as a teaching
and learning tool in a biomedical informatics course for college education.
The article details the design of the course and its methodology, including
hands-on learning, in-class activities, and weekly assignments that
utilized AI tools. An exploratory qualitative study was conducted with six
college students to learn their perceptions and learning experience with
this AI-incorporated course. We applied thematic analysis approach to
investigate the opportunities and challenges of integrating AI in college
education. The course generated positive outcomes, highlighting the
potential of AI tools in education and the importance of hands-on learning
and critical thinking. The results of thematic analysis agree with that AI
allowed students to more efficiently engage in metacognition. The article
concludes with a discussion on the implications of using AI in education
and the need for continued exploration and assessment of their impact on
student learning and success, for example, AI-human collaboration,
scaffolding support for AI-incorporated education, and students'
expectation for reliance on instructors. Overall, the study course provides
a case study of a novel integration of emerging AI tools and education in
biomedical informatics, showcasing the potential for personalized and
efficient learning experiences.},
