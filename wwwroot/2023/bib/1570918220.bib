ABSTRACT    = {Single cell technology refers to a set of scientific techniques that allows
researchers to study cellular structures in depth.The behaviors and
properties of individual cells may be hidden by traditional biological
experiments, which frequently measure averages over a large number of
cells. With the aid of single cell technology, scientists may examine each
cell separately and gain a much more in-depth understanding of biological
processes. Hence, a useful tool for examining cellular diversity is single
cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). However, the high dimensionality and
technical noise of scRNA-seq data make analysis difficult. To address this
issue, gene filtering has been widely adopted to minimize single cell data
noise and enhance the quality of subsequent analyses. Nonetheless, existing
gene filtering techniques may inadvertently omit critical but rare genes
which are necessary for identifying rare cell types that play a pivotal
role in comprehending many biological processes. A novel graph-based gene
selection technique is suggested in this study with the aim of preserving
the informative genes to better identify rare cell types. Our findings
demonstrate that this technique enhances the identification of rare cell
populations, providing a refined approach for scRNA-seq data analysis and
potentially enabling earlier and more reliable disease detection.},
