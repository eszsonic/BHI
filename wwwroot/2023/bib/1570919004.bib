ABSTRACT    = {Clinicians are usually under time pressure when they review patients'
electronic health records (EHR), therefore, there are great benefits to
providing clinicians high quality summarizations of patients' EHR. However,
existing summarization algorithms cannot satisfy their needs. In this
paper, we present a novel approach to summarize EHR notes using a guided
summarization model. Our model integrates a structured template developed
with a clinical domain expert, a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model and
sentence classification model for guidance extraction, and a fact-checking
metric for evaluating the generated summaries. We trained our model on a
large de-identified EHR dataset. The results demonstrate that our guidance,
which includes Chief Complaint (CC), NER, guidance from the History of
Present Illness (HPI) section, and guidance from the Medical Decision
Making (MDM) section, can significantly improve the performance of the
models in generating accurate and clinically meaningful summaries. The Gsum
(CNN) model with all the guidance aforementioned achieved the highest F1
score of 46.4, demonstrating the effectiveness of introducing precise and
informative guidance to models from the general domain when the training
data on the clinical domain is prohibitively sensitive and expensive. This
work contributes to the ongoing efforts to automate the summarization of
EHR notes, with the ultimate goal of improving healthcare delivery and
patient outcomes.},
