ABSTRACT    = {Delirium is a syndrome of acute brain failure which is prevalent amongst
older adults in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Incidence of delirium can
significantly worsen prognosis and increase mortality, therefore
necessitating its rapid and continual assessment in the ICU. Currently, the
common approach for delirium assessment is manual and sporadic. Hence,
there exists a critical need for a robust and automated system for
predicting delirium in the ICU. In this work, we develop a machine learning
(ML) system for real-time prediction of delirium using Electronic Health
Record (EHR) data. Unlike prior approaches which provide one delirium
prediction label per entire ICU stay, our approach provides predictions
every 12 hours. We use the latest 12 hours of ICU data, along with patient
demographic and medical history data, to predict delirium risk in the next
12-hour window. This enables delirium risk prediction as soon as 12 hours
after ICU admission. We train and test four ML classification algorithms on
longitudinal EHR data pertaining to 16,327 ICU stays of 13,395 patients
covering a total of 56,297 12-hour windows in the ICU to predict the
dynamic incidence of delirium. The best performing algorithm was
Categorical Boosting which achieved an area under receiver operating
characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.87 (95\% Confidence Interval; C.I,
0.86-0.87). The deployment of this ML system in ICUs can enable early
identification of delirium, thereby reducing its deleterious impact on
long-term adverse outcomes, such as ICU cost, length of stay and mortality.},
