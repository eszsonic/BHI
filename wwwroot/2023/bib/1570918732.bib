ABSTRACT    = {Current stress assessment methods include self-
reports and biomarkers which are evaluated in often complex,
laboratory procedures. Due to that investigating new indicators
for acute stress is crucial for the development of automatic stress
detection systems. A promising extension might be provided by
investigating speech, which has been shown to be affected by
negative emotions and threatening situations. For that reason,
we extracted verbal acoustics from audio data collected during
a study where N=21 participants underwent the Trier Social
Stress Test (TSST), the gold standard for laboratory stress in-
duction, and a stress-free control condition (friendly-TSST) while
concurrently collecting cortisol via saliva samples to assess the
biological response to stress. Our results show that acute stress
leads to significant (p < 0.05) alterations of acoustic features. A
stepwise backward multiple linear regression model explained
58.8 \% of the variance of the maximum cortisol increase. In addition to
that, we performed classification experiments that
distinguished stress from non-stress situations with an accuracy
of 80.0 Â± 12.7 \%. While further research is needed to validate our
approach, we are convinced that the information extracted from
speech can be a valuable indicator for automatic stress detection
systems and can even predict the biological response to stress
situations.},
