ABSTRACT    = {Lower limb arterial blockage (LLAB) is an early symptom of peripheral
arterial disease (PAD), a common circulatory problem caused by the
accumulation of fat and cholesterol in arteries as a result of
atherosclerosis in the lower limbs. PAD can be diagnosed by detecting LLAB,
which blocks the blood flow from leg to foot and causes a decrease of
plantar blood perfusion. Camera-based photoplethysmographic imaging, a
non-contact imaging technique for measuring skin perfusion, is a potential
tool to detect LLAB for the early diagnosis of PAD. Cameras have been used
for vital signs monitoring, such as heart rate, respiration rate and blood
oxygen saturation, but its potential for PAD analysis has not been
explored. In this paper, we investigate the new concept of using a regular
camera to measure the skin perfusion of plantar for LLAB detection. Instead
of imaging the facial skin perfusion as current vital signs camera, we use
the camera to analyze the blood perfusion of plantar skin surface. We
constructed an imaging setup and designed a lab-simulated experiment
involving 20 subjects, where an inflatable cuff is applied to block the
blood flow of the left leg to simulate LLAB. The experimental results show
that the camera-based plantar perfusion imagers can clearly differentiate
between the leg applied with cuff (simulated LLAB) and the leg in the
normal state.},
