ABSTRACT    = {Heart Transplant Rejection (HTR) is an exceedingly uncommon condition that
necessitates early detection for successful treatment and to prevent
lasting damage to the transplanted heart. Unfortunately, the current
diagnostic process is time-consuming and lacks consensus among medical
professionals. Introducing an automated diagnosis pipeline would greatly
streamline the clinical workflow, serving as an additional clinical
decision support tool that offers a second opinion to enhance agreement
among clinicians. Traditionally, developing an automated image analysis
tool of this nature requires a substantial amount of labeled data. However,
due to the rarity and inherent case imbalance of HTR, this task becomes
particularly challenging. Our dataset comprises 1,614 rejection tile images
and ~190 times more non-rejection tile images. To address the scarcity of
real-world examples, we present a novel approach featuring synthetic image
generation using a diffusion model, where synthetic images of rejection
were generated. We conducted a comparative analysis of classification using
the dataset both with and without synthetic rejection tiles. The
introduction of synthetic augmentation resulted in an improvement in
sensitivity from 0.781 to 0.981 and in AUROC from 0.984 to over 0.998.},
