ABSTRACT    = {Nulliparous pregnancies, those where the mother has not previously given
birth, are associated with longer labors and hence expose the fetus to more
contractions and other adverse intrapartum conditions such as
chorioamnionitis. The objective of the present study was to test if
accounting for nulliparity could improve the detection of fetuses at
increased risk of developing hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). During
labor, clinicians assess the fetal heart rate and uterine pressure signals
to identify fetuses at risk of developing HIE. In this study, we performed
random forest classification using fetal heart rate and uterine pressure
features from 40,831 births, including 374 that developed HIE. We analyzed
a two-path classification approach that analyzed separately the fetuses
from nulliparous and multiparous mothers, and a one-path classification
approach that included the clinical variable for nulliparity as a
classification feature. We compared these two approaches to a one-path
classifier that had no information about the parity of the mothers. We also
compared our results to the rate of Caesarean deliveries in each group,
which is used clinically to interrupt the progression towards HIE. All the
classifiers detected more fetuses that developed HIE than the observed
Caesarean rate, but   accounting for nulliparity did not improve
performance.},
