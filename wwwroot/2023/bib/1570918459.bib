ABSTRACT    = {Dementia is a term used to refer to a wide range of diseases that cause a
decline in cognitive abilities. This decline is severe enough to impair
daily life and it is extremely complex to diagnose in its early stages. In
recent years multiple Natural Language Processing solutions have been
proposed to automatically detect dementia. One of the main approaches to
this problem is based on extracting manually engineered features from a set
of patients' conversations and feeding them to traditional Machine Learning
models. These features can be divided into very different groups, and we
can define specific relations that connect one feature to the other. Thus,
we introduce a new way to approach the problem by organizing all the
extracted features in a graph structure and using Graph Machine Learning to
detect dementia. We validate our method using a well-established score
regression task and a newly proposed multi-class classification task. This
new task is based on the mapping between the Mini-Mental State Examination
score and multiple dementia severity levels. Compared to traditional
Machine Learning, our Graph Machine learning technique achieves a relative
increase in performance between 2.9\% and 8\% for the regression task, and
between 4.4\% and 7.9\% for the classification task.},
