ABSTRACT    = {CyberRwanda is a digital health intervention designed to increase knowledge
of family planning and reproductive health(FP/RH) and access to
youth-friendly services in Rwanda.
Previous studies showed high user satisfaction rates through user surveys,
success in combating social stigma, and an effective educational impact on
adolescents.
In order to further enhance user experience and overcome resource
limitations, the authors designed and developed new features, including an
integrated dashboard and chatbot, leveraging data engineering and natural
language processing. 
The experiments showed that new features substantially reduce the time
required to access information for user groups, potentially leading to an
improved user experience.
