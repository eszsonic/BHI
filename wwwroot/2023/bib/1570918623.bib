ABSTRACT    = {Post-surgical patient-reported outcomes (PROs) serve as a crucial
subjective measure of surgical success for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis
(AIS) patients. Leveraging pre-operative patient information to predict
post-operative PROs is instrumental in improving pediatric patient care and
providing invaluable insights for clinical decision-making. Recently, deep
learning techniques have demonstrated encouraging results in developing
predictive models for clinical decision support. However, the inherent
black-box nature makes them non-interactive and challenging to troubleshoot
during the training phase. To mitigate this issue, our study introduces an
interactive concept bottleneck model to predict subjective rehabilitation
outcomes for AIS patients. We assess three learning schemas - independent,
sequential, and joint - to first comprehend the concepts, which are a set
of post-operative radiographic data available during the training phase.
Subsequently, these acquired concepts are employed to predict
post-operative patient rehabilitation outcomes across five domains: pain,
function, general satisfaction, self-image, and mental health. Our results
demonstrated improvement compared to the existing baseline, with the joint
learning schema yielding the highest F1 score in the function and pain
domains, while sequential learning recorded the highest F1 score in the
mental health and self-image domains. This proposed framework harbors the
immense potential to aid pre-operative surgical planning and further
enhance the transparency of AI models, thereby supporting real-world
clinical decision-making.},
