ABSTRACT    = {The unpredictability of seizures imposes a significant burden on tens of
millions of individuals with epilepsy worldwide. The ability to
continuously monitor and forecast epileptic seizures would lead to a
paradigm shift in epilepsy management. In this paper, we propose a novel
progressive, personalized two-stage approach for seizure forecasting using
10-minute wearable time series data from wristbands worn by epilepsy
patients. Our method effectively tackles the challenges posed by class
imbalance and the complex nature of physiological signals. By measuring and
ranking the reconstruction error and energy the normal samples present to a
deep autoencoder and employing scheduled sampling, we demonstrate superior
performance over existing deep learning models, anomaly detection methods,
and class balancing during training. The proposed approach offers a
promising solution for seizure forecasting and has potential applications
in other medical problems characterized by imbalanced data and
physiological signals of high variability. The source code of this project
will be open-sourced upon acceptance.

Clinical relevance: The study demonstrates the potential for seizure
forecasting using wearable data and individualized treatment planning. Its
findings also highlight the value of adaptive learning mechanisms in
training deep learning models for imbalanced physiological healthcare data.

Key words: seizure forecasting; wearable data; scheduled sampling.},
