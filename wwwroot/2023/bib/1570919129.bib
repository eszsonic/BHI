ABSTRACT    = {Electronic health records (EHRs) often exhibit sparsity and irregularity
due to their inherent nature. It is crucial to consider that imputation and
aggregation techniques used during EHRs preprocessing can introduce
artificial and unrealistic data and potentially leading to the loss of
critical information. In this study, we proposed a temporal phenotype
matrix engineering approach with auxiliary data layer (ADL) to extract
important hidden information from EHRs. Our proposed approach was applied
to the early prediction of coronary artery disease (CAD), one of the
leading causes of death worldwide. We evaluated the performance of the
LSTM, CNN, and TCN models on the CAD prediction task. Upon applying our
proposed matrix engineering technique with ADL, we observed a substantial
improvement, with an AUROC (area under the receiver operating
characteristic) score of 0.919 ± 0.006 (a 10\% increase, compared to when
no ADL was included, 0.831 ± 0.011) in CNN model. In conclusion, this
study highlights the benefits of the proposed temporal phenotype matrix
engineering approach with ADL to address the sparsity and irregularity
inherent in EHRs data.
Our findings underscore the potential of the proposed temporal phenotype
matrix engineering approach with ADL for enhancing the early prediction of
CAD, thereby contributing to improved patient outcomes and reduced
mortality rates.},
