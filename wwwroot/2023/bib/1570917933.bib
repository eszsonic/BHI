ABSTRACT    = {Human Activity Recognition (HAR) plays a crucial role in numerous
applications, ranging from healthcare to sports analytics. This study
presents a novel approach to HAR that combines Artificial Neural Networks
(ANNs) and Random Forests to enhance the accuracy of HAR in diverse
real-world conditions, especially when dealing with noisy and imperfect
data. ANNs are known for extracting intricate features from raw data,
making them well-suited for classification. Random Forest excels at
learning from multiple decision trees and utilizing collective knowledge to
make predictions, making it suitable for handling data in real-world
applications. Harnessing the power of ANNs in feature extraction, coupled
with the collective decision-making capability of Random Forest, the
combined model demonstrates improved accuracy in classifying human
activities. This study showcases the potential of combining ANN and Random
Forest in classifying multi-dimensional Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)
data, a widely-used data source in HAR. By leveraging the strengths of both
ANN and Random Forest, the combined model addresses the challenges
associated with real, imperfect data, leading to a more robust and accurate
classification model. The results highlight the effectiveness of feature
extraction by ANNs and underscore the importance of incorporating Random
Forest in HAR systems to obtain 98.84\% accuracy. The findings of this
study offer valuable insights into the synergistic effects of combining ANN
and Random Forest for HAR. The outcomes can contribute to developing more
reliable and effective HAR systems, with potential applications in
healthcare monitoring, activity recognition in smart environments, and
other domains requiring accurate human activity classification.},
