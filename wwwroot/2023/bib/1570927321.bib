ABSTRACT    = {This study proposes an enhancement to the ConText-GAN, an image synthesis
model using a controllable texture input. The improvement consists in using
a texture feature fusion module to reduce the complexity of the model, and
enable the use of the OASIS architecture for image generation.

The ConText-GAN can be used to generate images of fake patients, which are
useful in the medical field due to the scarcity of data. An example is
given of the generation of images showing pathological muscle tissue in the
context of neuromuscular diseases.},
