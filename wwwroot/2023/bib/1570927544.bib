ABSTRACT    = {Respiratory infection testing, patient risk, and clinical costs are driven
by disease prevalence, direct and downstream costs of
false-positive/negative tests. In addition, false-positives decrease with
disease prevalence, while -negatives increase. We developed a host
response-based, easy to use, fast, low-cost, non-invasive respiratory
infection detection system and used COVID-19 as a mechanism for assessing
host vibroacoustic biosignatures based accuracy, sensitivity, and
specificity to distinguish SARS-CoV-2 carriers from non-carriers in a
diverse US, Indian, and African population. 
A vibroacoustic infrasound-to-ultrasound e-stethoscope that can detect a
respiratory infection early in both asymptomatic and vaguely  symptomatic,
like cough, patients that could be a tool  to meet current as well as
future needs as viral pathogens come and go, seasonally and within
pandemics.},
