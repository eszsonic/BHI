ABSTRACT    = {Facial expression recognition is a crucial aspect of human communication,
especially for building social relationships. However, machine-based
recognition remains a challenging task. Our research proposes an automatic
emotion identification system that utilizes emotional state heatmaps
(ES-MAPs) and neural network classification algorithms. Using MediaPipe
Face Mesh, our system extracts facial landmark coordinates and calculates
the distance between all landmarks. A neutral baseline is subtracted from
the landmark distances and saved as a heatmap to train a designed CNN
model. Our proposed system, ESH-Net, achieved significantly higher test
accuracies on several datasets compared to other SOTA models. In addition,
ES-MAPs produced better clustering than the original facial images,
indicating significant improvement in the separability and consistency of
representation of emotional states. This study demonstrates the potential
for emotional state heatmaps and deep learning models to significantly
improve the accuracy and efficiency of emotion identification, which can
greatly assist in assessing patient's emotional state in medical diagnosis
and practice.},
