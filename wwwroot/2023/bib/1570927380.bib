ABSTRACT    = {Epilepsy is a prevalent neurological disorder characterized by recurring
seizures, affecting approximately 50 million individuals globally. Given
the potential severity of the associated complications, early and accurate
seizure detection is crucial. In clinical practice, scalp
electroencephalograms (EEGs) are non-invasive tools widely used in seizure
detection and localization, aiding in the classification of seizure types.
However, manual EEG annotation is labor-intensive, costly, and suffers from
low inter-rater agreement, necessitating automated approaches.
To address this, we introduce a novel deep learning framework, combining a
convolutional neural network (CNN) module for temporal and spatial feature
extraction from multi-channel EEG data, and a transformer encoder module to
capture long-term sequential information.
We conduct extensive experiments on a public EEG seizure detection dataset,
achieving an unweighted average F1 score of 0.731, precision of 0.724, and
recall (sensitivity) of 0.744. We further replicate several EEG analysis
pipelines from literature and demonstrate that our pipeline outperforms,
current state-of-the-art approaches.
This work provides a significant step forward in automated seizure
detection. By enabling a more effective and efficient diagnostic tool, it
has the potential to significantly impact clinical practice, optimizing
patient care and outcomes in epilepsy treatment.},
