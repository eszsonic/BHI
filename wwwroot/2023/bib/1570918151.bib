ABSTRACT    = {The accurate detection and quantification of activities of daily life are
crucial for assessing the health status of palliative patients to allow an
optimized treatment in the last phase of life. Current evaluation methods
heavily rely on subjective self-reports or external observations by
clinical staff, lacking objectivity. To address this limitation, we propose
a radar-based approach for recognizing ADLs in a palliative care context.
In our proof of concept study, we recorded five different activities of
daily living relevant to palliative care, all occurring within a hospital
bed, from N=14 healthy participants (57 \% women, aged 28.6 ± 5.3 years).
All movements were recorded using two frequency-modulated continuous wave
radar systems measuring velocity, range, and angle. A convolutional neural
network combined with long short-term memory achieved a classification
accuracy of 99.8 ± 0.4 \% across five cross-validation folds. Furthermore,
we compare our initial approach, which takes into account all dimensions of
the available radar data, to a simplified version, where only velocity
information over time is fed into the network. While these results
demonstrate the high potential of radar-based sensing to automatically
detect and quantify activities in a palliative care context, future work is
still necessary to assess the applicability to real-world hospital
scenarios.},
