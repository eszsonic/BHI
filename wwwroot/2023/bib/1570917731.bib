ABSTRACT    = {Neonatal endotracheal intubation (ETI) is an intricate medical procedure
that poses considerable challenges, demanding comprehensive training to
effectively address potential complications in clinical practice. However,
due to limited access to clinical opportunities, ETI training heavily
relies on physical manikins to develop a certain level of competence before
clinical exposure. Nonetheless, traditional training methods prove
ineffective due to scarcity of expert instructors and the absence of
internal situational awareness within the manikins, preventing thorough
performance assessment for both trainees and instructors. To address this
gap, there is a need to develop an automatic grading system that can assist
trainees in performance assessment. In this paper, we propose a multi-task
Convolutional Neural Network (MTCNN) based model for assessing ETI
proficiency, specifically targeting key performance features recommended by
expert instructors. The model comprises three modules: a motion recording
and visualization module that captures the ETI procedures performed on a
standard neonatal task trainer manikin, an automatic grading module that
extracts and grades the identified key performance features, and a data
visualization module that presents the assessment results in a
user-friendly manner. The experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed automatic grading system achieves an average classification
accuracy of 93.6\%. This study establishes the successful integration of
intuitive observed features with latent features derived from multivariate
time series (MTS) data, coupled with multi-task deep learning techniques,
for the automatic assessment of ETI performance.},
