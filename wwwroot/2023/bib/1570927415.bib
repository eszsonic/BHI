ABSTRACT    = {In this study, we present an innovative approach that integrates EEG-based
functional connectivity analysis and MRI-derived cortical thickness
measurements, reflecting the principles of Precision Systems Medicine. This
combined methodology enhances the precision of Focal Cortical Dysplasia
(FCD) lesion validation in preoperative assessments for pediatric epilepsy,
thereby establishing a foundation for improved surgical outcomes. Our case
study confirms the consistent detection of the Caudal Middle Frontal
region, supporting the potential of our method to increase the accuracy of
surgical planning for FCD-related epilepsy. The broader implications extend
to neurology and precision medicine, embodying a systems-level
understanding of individual patients. While we recognize the need for
further large-scale research, our study represents a significant stride
towards a comprehensive, patient-centered, and data-driven approach to
epilepsy treatment planning. This resonates with the objective of Precision
Systems Medicine-delivering highly individualized healthcare based on
complex system-level patient understanding.},
