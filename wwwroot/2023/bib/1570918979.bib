ABSTRACT    = {Hypertension is commonly referred to as ``silent killer{"}, since it can
lead to severe health complications without any visible symptoms. Early
detection of hypertension is crucial in preventing significant health
issues. Although some studies suggest a relationship between blood pressure
and certain vital signals, such as Photoplethysmogram (PPG), reliable
generalization of the proposed blood pressure estimation methods is not
guaranteed yet. This has resulted in some studies doubting the existence of
such relationships or considering them weak and limited to heart rate and
blood pressure. In this paper, a high-dimensional representation technique
based on random convolution kernels is proposed to demonstrate the
feasibility of generalization in hypertension detection using PPG signals.
Our results provide evidence that this relationship extends beyond heart
rate and blood pressure. Additionally, we show that the utilized transform
using convolution kernels, as an end-to-end time-series feature extractor
method, performs better than the methods proposed in the previous studies
and state-of-the-art deep learning models.
Clinical relevance- The findings of this study highlight the feasibility of
hypertension detection using PPG signals. This could be useful for the
early detection of high blood pressure and reducing the risk of
hypertension going unnoticed, particularly using wearable devices such as
smartwatches equipped with PPG sensors.},
