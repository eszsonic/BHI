ABSTRACT    = {Gastric Intestinal Metaplasia (GIM) is a precancerous gastric lesion and
its early detection facilitates patient followup, thus lowering
significantly the risk of death by gastric cancer. However, effective
screening of this condition is a very challenging task, resulting low intra
and inter-observer concordance. Computer assisted diagnosis systems
leveraging deep neural networks (DNNs) have emerged as a way to mitigate
these ailments. Notwithstanding, these approaches typically require large
datasets in order to learn invariance to the extreme variations typically
present in Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) still frames, such as
perspective, illumination, and scale. Hence, we propose to combine a priori
information regarding texture characteristics of GIM with data-driven DNN
solutions. In particular, we define two different models that treat
pre-trained DNNs as general features extractors, whose pairwise
interactions with a collection of highly invariant local texture
descriptors grounded on fractal geometry are computed by means of an outer
product in the embedding space. Our experiments show that these models
outperform a baseline DNN by a significant margin over several metrics
(e.g., area under the curve (AUC) 0.792 vs. 0.705) in a dataset comprised
of EGD narrow-band images. Our best model measures double the positive
likelihood ratio when compared to a baseline GIM detector.},
