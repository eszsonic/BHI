The objective of the present study was to test if accounting for nulliparity could improve the detection of fetuses at increased risk of developing hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). During labor, clinicians assess the fetal heart rate and uterine pressure signals to identify fetuses at risk of developing HIE. In this study, we performed random forest classification using fetal heart rate and uterine pressure features from 40,831 births, including 374 that developed HIE. We analyzed a two-path classification approach that analyzed separately the fetuses from nulliparous and multiparous mothers, and a one-path classification approach that included the clinical variable for nulliparity as a classification feature. We compared these two approaches to a one-path classifier that had no information about the parity of the mothers. We also compared our results to the rate of Caesarean deliveries in each group, which is used clinically to interrupt the progression towards HIE. All the classifiers detected more fetuses that developed HIE than the observed Caesarean rate, but   accounting for nulliparity did not improve performance.<br><br><b>Keywords: Machine learning; Fetal heart rate; Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy; Fetal acidosis; Clinical risk factor<br> <br><h2>Links</h2>[<a href="pdfs/1570918874.pdf">Full text PDF</a>][<a href="bib/1570918874.bib">Bibtex</a>] <br> </html>
