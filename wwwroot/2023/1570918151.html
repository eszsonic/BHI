Current evaluation methods heavily rely on subjective self-reports or external observations by clinical staff, lacking objectivity. To address this limitation, we propose a radar-based approach for recognizing ADLs in a palliative care context. In our proof of concept study, we recorded five different activities of daily living relevant to palliative care, all occurring within a hospital bed, from N=14 healthy participants (57 % women, aged 28.6 ± 5.3 years). All movements were recorded using two frequency-modulated continuous wave radar systems measuring velocity, range, and angle. A convolutional neural network combined with long short-term memory achieved a classification accuracy of 99.8 ± 0.4 % across five cross-validation folds. Furthermore, we compare our initial approach, which takes into account all dimensions of the available radar data, to a simplified version, where only velocity information over time is fed into the network. While these results demonstrate the high potential of radar-based sensing to automatically detect and quantify activities in a palliative care context, future work is still necessary to assess the applicability to real-world hospital scenarios.<br><br><b>Keywords: activities of daily living; radar; deep learning; human activity recognition; palliative care<br> <br><h2>Links</h2>[<a href="pdfs/1570918151.pdf">Full text PDF</a>][<a href="bib/1570918151.bib">Bibtex</a>] <br> </html>
