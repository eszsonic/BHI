<h1> A Preliminary Study on Adapting Large Language Models on Electronic Health Records for Survival Prediction of Alzheimer's Disease</h1><br><i><b> Degan Hao; Shruthi Venkatesh; Michele Morris; Zongqi Xia; Shandong Wu</b></i><br><h2>Abstract</h2><br>Alzheimer's disease, marked by memory loss and cognitive decline, places a significant burden on nations with aging populations. Precise survival prediction for patients with Alzheimer's disease could guide disease management strategies and enhance patient care. However, the utilization of Electronic Health Records (EHR) for survival prediction often presents challenges due to the interdisciplinary knowledge required to interpret the clinical language within narrative notes. In this study, we introduce a novel method for survival prediction in  patients with Alzheimer's disease by utilizing a fine-tuned large language model, AD-GPT, trained specifically on EHR data. AD-GPT, built on top of GPT-3, can not only answer questions from general-purpose natural language, but also specialize in survival prognosis from Alzheimer's disease-related EHR data. Our proposed method is validated on a de-identified clinical cohort of 476 patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease for survival prediction. We also compared the proposed method with a clinical model. With its superior performance in survival prediction compared to related methods, AD-GPT shows promising potential for more accurate prediction at an individual level, aiding in the management and treatment of Alzheimer's disease. This study also demonstrates how large language models may transfer their general AI knowledge to potentially improve a specific clinical task.<br><br><b>Keywords: nan<br> <br><h2>Links</h2>[<a href="pdfs/1570919005.pdf">Full text PDF</a>][<a href="bib/1570919005.bib">Bibtex</a>] <br> </html>
