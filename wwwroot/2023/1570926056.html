<h1> Transforming Adolescent Healthcare in Rwanda: Sustainable and Scalable Features in Digital Health</h1><br><i><b> Diane Myung-kyung Woodbridge; Tejaswi Samrat Dasari; Pratima Satish; Laetitia Kayitesi; Mary Mbuvi; Fabiola Ishimwe Ngamije; Joseph Kwesiga; Robert On; Russell Dias</b></i><br><h2>Abstract</h2><br>CyberRwanda is a digital health intervention designed to increase knowledge of family planning and reproductive health(FP/RH) and access to youth-friendly services in Rwanda.
Previous studies showed high user satisfaction rates through user surveys, success in combating social stigma, and an effective educational impact on adolescents.
In order to further enhance user experience and overcome resource limitations, the authors designed and developed new features, including an integrated dashboard and chatbot, leveraging data engineering and natural language processing. 
The experiments showed that new features substantially reduce the time required to access information for user groups, potentially leading to an improved user experience.
